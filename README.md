# Navigation Commands in Bash

## Learning Goals

- Define a Unix path
- Identify typical Unix "Home Directory" paths
- Identify my logged-in username with `whoami`
- Identify the current working directory" with `pwd` ("print working directory")
- Navigate up one directory in the file system
- Navigate back to a home directory
- Demonstrate how to navigate the CLI with Bash

## Introduction

Using the CLI (command line interface) might seem like a big challenge to first-
time users who are afraid of making mistakes that could break their computers or
ruin their files. Fear not! We'll step you through it.

The command-line interfaces, or "shells", used on OSX, Linux, and the "Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)," are called `bash`. In this lesson, we're going to
explore the command-line interface in a bit more detail. To help us, we're
going to us the simulated command-line interface in Learn's In Browser IDE.

To follow along, click 'Sandbox' and use the simulated CLI. The exact details
and examples may differ.

## Demonstrate How to Navigate with `bash`

To review: `bash` is a text-based interpreter that provides a _command-line
interface_ for controlling your computer (or operating system).

> **ASIDE**: Bash is actually an acronym which stands for **B**ourne-**A**gain
> **SH**ell. As the word "again" suggests, there are _other_ shells, some of
> which came before `bash`. There are also shells that have come along _since_ > `bash`. Nevertheless, most programmers use `bash` or something very similar.

A great place to start learning about the CLI is by using it to do a task
you're already familiar with: looking to see what's inside folders like
your directories and desktop. Programmers call this activity: _navigating_.
In the CLI, we imagine that we're "traveling" to different places. We'll use
metaphors like "go into the folder" or "go up one folder" or "visit the location
at such-and-such _path_."

As you learn to navigate with the shell and get to used to it, you'll see that
it's friendlier than it might seem at first. In no time, you'll be looking like

### Identify Our "Home Directory"

Whenever you open a terminal session (new window, new terminal tab, launching
the program for the first time after a reboot), you will be placed in (remember
our "travel" metaphor!) your home directory. Directory names on Unix systems are
written like:

`/parentdirectory/subdirectory/another/subdirectory/`

We call a bit of text meant to communicate location on a file system a _path_.
Paths use `/` to show levels of "nesting."

For example, a user's home directory is often written like: `/Users/username` or
`/home/username`. The `/` on the far left of the path name means the very top of
the file system "tree." The `/` directory is also called the "root" directory.
It contains all the "top-level directories" that can contain sub-directories
(...which can contain subdirectories, which can contain subdirectories, on and
on).

**NOTE:** When navigating through a directory, it often helps if we picture the
file structure like a tree. With this visualization, we can refer to "moving
up" or "moving down" between directory levels, and keep better track of not
only where our files are but where we are among our files. Here's an example:

!["Directory tree structure diagram"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/directory-tree.png)

Let's take a second to look at some typical home directories:

`/Users/username`

This means the "root" contains a directory called `Users` and `Users` contains
`username`. Paths like this are typical for Mac OSX.

`/home/username`

This means the "root" contains a directory called `home` and `home` contains
`username`. Paths like this are typical for Linux.

Obviously, our names (well, most of our names) are not `username`. Instead, we
log into our systems as `Byron Poodle` or `Nancy the Cat`. How can we find out
what our logged-in-user name is?

Let's ask the shell to tell us who it thinks we are. We'll use `whoami` to do
just this in the next section.

### Identify My Logged-In Username with `whoami`

Let's start simply. Let's ask the computer who I am logged in as:

```bash
$ whoami
```

!["whoami"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/whoami.jpg)

The `whoami` command lets you see which user account you're logged in to from
the CLI. This might seem obvious, especially if you're logged in on your
personal computer. But Unix machines have multiple accounts by default (though
you may not have seen them yet).

My system says I am `kellyegreene`. Based on what we learned about home
directories, what do you think my home directory _path_ is? In the next section,
we'll ask the shell to tell us what our home directory's path is.

If you are using the Learn In Browser IDE, your user account will be
the github account name tied to Learn.

### Identify the Current Working Directory" With `pwd` ("print working directory")

```bash
$ pwd
```

**Note:** _Any time you see the_ `$` _character, you shouldn't type it in. This
is just a standard way to represent a bash prompt. Yours may or may not be a_
`$`.

You should see some output describing the directory you are currently in. It's
probably something like `/Users/byron_the_poodle`.

The `pwd` command stands for "**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory". As you "navigate" your
file system, you might get lost. Just like wandering in a big city, you can look
for street signs to find out where you are. The `pwd` command acts like those
street signs. You'll never be lost again!

We've just used `pwd` to demonstrate that when we open a `bash` session the
operating system automatically "puts" us in our home directory. Let's now do
some real "navigation." In the next section, we'll learn to move "up" one
containing directory.

### Navigate Up One Directory in the File System

Try typing this in the command line:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ pwd
```

You "moved up" one level of nesting, so you should now see that you are one
level up from where you were and one level closer to the "root" directory. In
your terminal see this by using `pwd`:

`/Users`

The `cd` command stands for "**c**hange **d**irectory".

The `..` is a shortcut for the directory _above_ the working directory. The
`bash` shell provides a series of "shortcuts" for some commonly-used file system
paths. `..` means "this directory's containing folder." These shortcuts look
strange but they're designed to be _short_ and therefore _easy to type_ and
therefore _fast_ and, as we've hinted, the CLI is all about speed.

So in this command example, we said: `change directory to the parent folder`.
You can do this all the way back up to the `/` directory.

Let's use `cd` to get back to our home directory.

### Change Directories Using `cd`

The `bash` shell provides the default shortcut for your home directory: `~`. Use
`cd ..` to go "up" a few directories (why not all the way to the root?).

Then, when you run this command:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ pwd
```

You'll see you're back in your home directory. Use `pwd` to verify!

> **SHORTCUT** By the way, if you enter `cd` with no argument, you'll
> be taken to your home directory.

Another shortcut, that might seem not too useful at first, is `.` meaning "the
current directory I'm in."

If you try this command:

```bash
$ cd .
$ pwd
```

You should see you are still in the same directory where you wrote
the command.

Instead of using shortcuts like `..`, `.`, or `~`, you can give a
path to `cd` and it will "take" you there.

Try `cd /Applications` or even `cd /`. You can run a `pwd` in these directories
and see that you've "navigated into" them. Try `cd alksdjfalksdjfalskdjf`. What
error does `bash` give you? Is that what you expected? We'll discuss more
about the types of paths you can give `bash` in the next section.

### Paths in Shell

The path supplied to the `cd` command can be either _absolute_ or _relative_
paths. An absolute path is a path that always gets you to the same folder. You
can recognize them because they start with `/`. For example,
`/Users/kellyegreene`, is an absolute path.

A relative path is a path **relative** to the working directory you're "in" at
the time you write the command. They start
with the name of a directory or a file. For example `kellyegreene/Documents`, is
a relative path.

If I were in my home directory `/Users/kellyegreene` and I had a directory
`mixtapes` containing a subdirectory, `the-masked-rapper-vol-1`, I could type
`cd mixtapes/the-masked-rapper-vol-1`, and it would and the shell would navigate
into the `the-masked-rapper-vol-1` folder.

If I were in `/Users/annoyingbrother` and said
`cd mixtapes/the-masked-rapper-vol-1`, `bash` would return an error because that
sub-directory doesn't exist there (because I, Kellye Greene, am the Masked
Rapper, while my brother can't rhyme).

Absolute paths and relative paths might sound confusing in the CLI universe, but
we intuitively understand this difference in our day-to-day lives. We usually call
this difference _context_.

If someone asks if you want to go get a slice of pizza for lunch they're probably
thinking of somewhere close to where you're currently located â€“
somewhere close _relatively_ speaking. They're expecting you to say something like:

"Oh yeah, let's go West on 18th street, cross 6th Avenue and go to the place on
the corner."

What would surprise the heck out of them would be if you gave them absolute
coordinates; and it would be _even more_ surprising if that location were far
away. How might they react if you said:

"Oh yeah, let's go to 41.890221 and -87.633904!"

Latitude and longitude give _absolute_ directions based on the Equator and Prime
Meridian. They're not commonly used by humans to make decisions on where to get
lunch (even if they point, in fact, to one of our favorite pizzerias in
Chicago).

So far, we've been finding out where we are in the file system "tree," how about
we find out what's _in_ these directories (besides other directories)? We'll
cover that in our next lesson.

## Time-Saving Tip: Tab Completion

As you type in commands in the shell, you can use "tab completion." Tab
completion allows the shell to be smart and to try and guess what command you
want to run when you hit the tab. If there's only one logical way to complete
your command, `bash` will fill in the rest for you, or will show you the
possibilities and you can add more letters until you can tab-complete your
command.

For example, let's say we have the following directory structure with two sub-
directories:

```bash
college_dorm/
college_campus/
```

If I type `$ cd c` and then hit tab, it will fill in everything up until the
conflict so I'll see `$ cd college_`. If I then add the `d` and hit tab it
will fill in `$ cd college_dorm` and I can hit enter.

## Conclusion

As we keep exploring and working with the command line, we will start to unlock
and understand its full potential! Adopting the terminal
can allow us to become more productive users.
